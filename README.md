# AIPS Coding Challenge The Task
An automated traffic counter sits by a road and counts the number of cars that go
past. Every half-hour the counter outputs the number of cars seen and resets the counter to zero. You are part of a development team that has been asked to implement a system to manage this data - the first task required is as follows:
Write a program that reads a file, where each line contains a timestamp (in yyyy-mm- ddThh:mm:ss format, i.e. ISO 8601) for the beginning of a half-hour and the number of cars seen that half hour. An example file is included on page 2. You can assume clean input, as these files are machine-generated.

## Desired Output

The number of cars seen in total
A sequence of lines where each line contains a date (in yyyy-mm-dd format) and thenumber of cars seen on that day (eg. 2016-11-23 289) for all days listed in the input file.
The top 3 half hours with most cars, in the same format as the input file
The 1.5 hour period with least cars (i.e. 3 contiguous half hour records)

## Code Description
Using Python 3.9 to solve the above mentioned challenge
Pandas (python Library is used to work with dataframe)
